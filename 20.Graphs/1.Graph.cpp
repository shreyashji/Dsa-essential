//to represent graph
//1.adjency list =lis<list>,array<list>,vector<list>,vector<vector>
//adv of adj list=>get neighbours directly
//2.adjency matrix
//disadv-> waste of memory, get neighbours in O(v)
//3.edge list
//sorting based on edge weights
//4.implicit graph

//graph applications
//1.shortest paths
//2.social n/w
//3.resolving dependency on servers (dag)
// data pkt routing 
//ml/deep learning
//computer vision
//web crawlers in bfs
//graph based  db=neo4j used for recommendation engines ,fraud detection,
//brain is n/w of neuron
