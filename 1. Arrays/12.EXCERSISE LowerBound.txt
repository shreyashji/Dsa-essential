/*
Given an array of integers A (sorted) and a integer Val.
Implement a function that takes A and Val as input parameters and returns the lower bound of Val.
note:  Lower bound of a given integer means integer which is just smaller than given integer.
Example 1  :
A = [-1, -1, 2, 3, 5]
Val = 4
Answer :  3
Since 3 is just smaller than 4 in the array.
Example 2  :
A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 6]
Val = 4
Answer :  4
Since 4 is equal to 4.
